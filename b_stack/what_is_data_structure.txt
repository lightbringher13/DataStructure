data ----> memory +
write, read, insert, delete, search = data structure
algorithm = finithe operations to answer using data structure

ex variable 
a = 5 --> write 
print(a) --> read
in python variable a does not store the value itself 
it stores the memory address of the object

ex array
a = [3 -1 5 7]
write, read using index 
a[3] = 3, print(a[4])
insert 
a.append(34)
delete
a.pop(3),a.pop()
