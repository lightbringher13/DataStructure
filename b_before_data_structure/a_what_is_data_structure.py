# data structure is data ----> memory + write, read, insert,
# delete, search

# algorithm = finite operations to find the answer
# using data structure

# ex) variable
# a = 5 --> write
# print(a) --> read
# in python variable a does not store the value itself
# it stores the memory address of the object

# ex) array
# a = [3 -1 5 7]
# write, read using index
# a[3] = 3, print(a[4])
# insert
# a.append(34)
# delete
# a.pop(3),a.pop()
